CMake Warning (dev) at /home/liam/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cmake/data/share/cmake-3.18/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:273 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (PkgConfig)
  does not match the name of the calling package (gazebo).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.

CMake Warning (dev) at /home/liam/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cmake/data/share/cmake-3.18/Modules/FindBoost.cmake:1315 (if):
  Policy CMP0054 is not set: Only interpret if() arguments as variables or
  keywords when unquoted.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0054" for policy
  details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
  warning.

  Quoted variables like "chrono" will no longer be dereferenced when the
  policy is set to NEW.  Since the policy is not set the OLD behavior will be
  used.
